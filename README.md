# Hi, I'm One 👋

I'm an incoming Informatics student currently building my foundation in software development and practical computing. Most of my work here revolves around exploring how code, logic, and systems interact — and how those pieces evolve into real, usable technology.

### 🌱 What I'm Learning
- Programming fundamentals and software best practices  
- Version control, project structure, and documentation  
- Web development basics and general problem-solving  
- Tools like VS Code, Git, and modern development workflows  

### 🔧 What I'm Working On
- Small projects to strengthen my understanding of software basics  
- Experiments with different stacks to find what suits me  
- Clean, readable code and simple architectures  
- Personal notes and learning roadmaps as I prepare for university  

### 🎯 What I Aim For
- A solid technical foundation before entering university  
- A clear understanding of how systems and software scale  
- A long-term path toward working in the European tech ecosystem  

### 📫 Reach Me
Always open to discussions about computing, software, and study planning.  
Feel free to reach out or check out my repositories — everything here is part of my journey into Informatics.
